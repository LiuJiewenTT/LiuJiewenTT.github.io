## Website

Hello, my friends! I've recently enabled this interesting thing. I'm going to post some blogs here and release my software here. 
It's pretty nice to meet you here. Best wishes in the days to come.

*(I shall save history copies in some directory.)*

## Blogs

Well, I'm recently learning about protocols concerning open source. I would publish my thoughts  after I'm ok with CC. Here I shall declare the upcoming blog's title.

### 开源与收费

*Coming soon...*

## Software

### mcmod

It's a software help to manage Minecraft mods. 
Apache License, 2.0.

**Available!** Click [here to download][https://github.com/LiuJiewenTT/mcmod/releases/download/v1.0.0/mcmod_v1.0_release.zip] version 1.0!

### MCVINE

The successor of mcmod project. It can inject shaders, configs and so on. It's more powerful than mcmod and it will give you better MCNE experience in the real meaning. **BUT, it would not be free to get one.** (Together with support service.)

*Coming soon... Version 1.1 to 1.4 have been developed already. They will be available as soon as the payment is ready and the apache licenses are added.*

*You may get a copy of v1.2 immediately if you can use E-CNY to pay. Contact me at liuljwtt@foxmail.com*

### ThreadKiller

Ban the threads you don't want. You can use this to make simple management or joke with your friends. (e.g., try adding explorer.exe to the target list :smile:)

The base part is planned to be open sourced. But there are experience-improved plans as well. (Together with support service.)

*Coming soon...*

### BlackCurtain

Do you have times when you want some .exe or .bat running without window? Here comes the assisting tool! You can get one if you make a small donation. (Free support service. Although it should not have any problem.)

### More tools

- 数据填充
- Java_Active_Mode
- C++_Active_Mode
- ShutClock
- C2D
- Del 1
- Computer Locker(Cl)

### Charging and Support Service

If you pay for some product and its service, you will get the support service for free. **BUT, please use the same email address to contact. I use email address to identify who you are, for now. Support Service is only available for customers who paid to me.**

### Why charging

Developing products cost resources, paying is a normal means of exchanging. Suitable fee is beneficial for further development. I will be very grateful if you acknowledge me and make a donation!
