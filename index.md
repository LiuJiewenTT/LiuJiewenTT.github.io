# About Me

Hey, guys! I'm TT. I use many names: *LiuJiewenTT*, *AlfredTT*, *AlfredTTLJW* or *TTPeter*, and shorted as *TT*.

I like to code something or anything else as long as it's about creating something great! I play *Minecraft*, *Left 4 Dead 2* and so on and I made some programs to help me play with those. I like the free ideas of free software and I shared my viewpoint on it. I also tried to develop a variant of MIT, a Open Source License. But, don't be serious. In shorts, I do everything that seems to make a better future.

The coding languages that I'm skilled at: *c/c++*, *python*, *batch*. I can do with these as well: *Java*, *HTML*, *PHP*. I have some knowledge of Android Application development and have already released some of my work.

I note down what I saw in the life and technology field and share some in my online library: [MyDoc_A](https://liujiewentt.github.io/MyDoc_A/) .

To contact me, you may email to <liuljwtt@foxmail.com>. Other personal homepages: [on Bilibili.com](https://space.bilibili.com/504959893) and [on afadian.net](https://afdian.net/@AlfredTT).

## Recent

1. [**Newest**]*Bobing* game is formally released.
2. Keeps building personal public library.
3. Game assistant for *Left 4 Lead 2* is ready.
4. The renderer met a performance problem. (*pinball_game*)

## My Projects

### Games

Until now, most of them are uncompleted because I tried to develop my own render engine. They are in *python* and uses *OpenCV* library. Maybe it's a mistake. 

Some projects, *tankgame*, *tankgame_lite1* and *pinball_game*, are the efforts I made. Another larger project relevant is *新墨(XinMo)*, but that is more about drawing not gaming. If you'd like to help, please go to *pinball_game*. I'd really appreciate you!

#### Bobing Game

**Environment**: Android System
**Highlights**: Provide some interesting customization options.
Comment: It's an assignment of two people.
Project link: <https://github.com/LiuJiewenTT/ee308fz_lab2>

It features on a traditional Chinese game, *Bobing*. 

**Available!** Click [here](https://github.com/LiuJiewenTT/ee308fz_lab2/releases) to download *released versions*.

### Game Surroundings

List some:

- BirdMC
- mcmod
- MCVINE
- L4D2 OfflineAssistant

I also made a [datapack](https://github.com/TTStudio-of-TTPeter/byTTPeter_Recipe_Datapack) for combination of: *Minecraft* + *Forge* + *Create* + *Ex Nihilo: Sequentia* + *Farmer's Delight* + *Pigsteel* and so on.

#### BirdMC

**Environment**: python 3.7 + opencv-python
**Highlights**: Single file program; Provide options;
Project Link: <https://github.com/LiuJiewenTT/BirdMC_original>

This program allows you to select patches to be divided and then send to make blueprints for pictures on *Minecraft* maps.

Some **options** are provided for customization.

#### mcmod&MCVINE

**Environment**: batch(cmd)
**Highlights**: Addon mechanism; Multiple approaches/implementations; Support multiple configurations;

They can insert things into the targeted locations. *MCVINE* is the successor of *mcmod*. They help to solve the problem of having difficulties and inconvenience when playing Minecraft Java Edition, Chinese version(Netease agented). **Mods, resourcepacks, shaderpacks, configs, etc.** are supported. 

As the room id is not fixed, configs may need special adapters depending on whether map-related. Adapters can be called through **addon mechanism**. 

> Yes, lots of my work support addon mechanism and holding a good flexibility even goes to debugging and maintaining.

#### L4D2_OfflineAssistant

**Environment**: batch(cmd)
**Highlights**: Support multiple configurations;
Project Link: <https://github.com/LiuJiewenTT/L4D2_OfflineAssistant>

Similar propose to the *mcmod*. Assure MODs would not disappear unexpectedly. Support multiple configurations and easy switch. 

> **File from local while description from the internet.**

### Software

List some:

1. PortAPP
2. Active Mode
3. ThreadKiller
4. BlackCurtain
5. Computer Locker(Cl)

#### PortAPP

**Environment**: batch(cmd), vbs
**Highlights**: Portable;
Project Link: <https://github.com/LiuJiewenTT/PortAPP>

Features:

1. Use it along with a Service, **user accounts(Windows)** can be located at some location in outer disk/portable disk. (Need proper settings)

2. With this, a portable disk can be used for different PCs and every PC won't access to wrong path of softwares installed in the disk! In other words, Apps are separated by the name of every PC.

#### Active Mode

**Environment**: batch(cmd)
**Highlights**: Portable; Very small; Work with commandline; Agile Coding;

It's a **Basic IDE in batch script**. It's a light-weighted IDE based on commandline. **It aims to let you do things in agile way without any thinking of those not important.** It's provided in two language versions: *C/C++*, *Java*.

Ban the threads you don't want. You can use this to make simple management or joke with your friends. (e.g., try adding explorer.exe to the target list :smile:)

The base is `BlackCurtain`, whose work is now opened and will have further development of UI like `ThreadKiller`.

**Available!** Click [here](https://github.com/TTStudio-of-TTPeter/ThreadKiller) to view the project. And there do has a `.exe` installer for Win platform!

You may see it [here](https://github.com/LiuJiewenTT/BlackCurtain) and develop a version of yours.
