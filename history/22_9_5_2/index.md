In the last few month, I made multiple tries to build a python renderer. There are there incomplete projects concerning this topic. Today(2022.9.5) I made a small classic game and sadly to find: the speeding is really disappointing. I'm not sure if it's because indexing, you may take a glance from my project: `pinball_game`. I would be very grateful if somebody help me!!!!!
(Referring to situation of considering alpha tunnel, transparency. `lapTIMG()`is used.)

## Website

Hello, my friends! I've recently unlocked this interesting thing. I'm going to post some blogs here and release my softwares here. 
It's pretty nice to meet you here. Best wishes in the days to come.

*(I shall save history copies in some directory.)*

## Teams

I create a team named TTStudio (in fact, it's `TTStudio-of-TTPeter`). See it [here](https://github.com/TTStudio-of-TTPeter)!

### 开源与收费

## Abouts

### Charging and Support Service

If you pay for some product and its service, you will get the support service for free. **BUT, please use the same email address to contact. I use email address to identify who you are, for now. Support Service is only available for customers who paid to me.**

### Why charging

Developing products cost resources, paying is a normal means of exchanging. Suitable fee is beneficial for further development. I will be very grateful if you acknowledge me and make a donation!

### My effort to open community

And I made effort to open community by customizing an MIT license. See it [Here!](https://github.com/TTStudio-of-TTPeter/TTPeter-s-MIT-like-License)
This protocol is almost the same as MIT except for the commercial use aspect. The restriction is about how commercial use will be permitted so that developers also gain some benefits. The license is aimed to make a perfect balance between dream and survival of free software. It's a rather rough protocol that has a rough criterion. This is best for small projects. In fact, I hope more people will choose this customized license when they're about to choose MIT. For details, see it [here!](https://github.com/TTStudio-of-TTPeter/TTPeter-s-MIT-like-License)
