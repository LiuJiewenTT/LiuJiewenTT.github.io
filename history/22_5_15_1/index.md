## Website

Hello, my friends! I've recently unlocked this interesting thing. I'm going to post some blogs here and release my softwares here. 
It's pretty nice to meet you here. Best wishes in the days to come.

*(I shall save history copies in some directory.)*

## Blogs

### 开源与收费

**Topic**: The relationship of open-source and charging-fee.

> ps. It's about my personal thinking of the topic. Hence, the passage is given in Chinese language. You may need translation tools.

[*Available Now!*](https://github.com/LiuJiewenTT/LiuJiewenTT.github.io/tree/main/blogs/开源与收费_SharedVersion_Export/开源与收费_SharedVersion_Interact.md)

## Softwares

### mcmod

It's a software help to manage Minecraft mods. <br>

**Available!** Click [here to download](https://github.com/LiuJiewenTT/mcmod/releases/download/v1.0.0/mcmod_v1.0_release.zip) version 1.0!

### MCVINE

The successor of mcmod project. It can inject shaders, configs and so on. It's more powerful than mcmod and it will give you better MCNE experience in the real meaning. **BUT, it would not be free to get one.** (Together with support service.)

### ThreadKiller

Ban the threads you don't want. You can use this to make simple management or joke with your friends. (e.g., try adding explorer.exe to the target list :smile:)

The base is `BlackCurtain`, whose work is now opened and will have further development of UI like `ThreadKiller`.

*Coming soon...*

### BlackCurtain

Do you have times when you want some .exe or .bat running without window? Here comes the assisting tool! You can get one if you make a small donation. (Free support service. Although it should not have any problem.) 

The work is also an open-source project(*MIT license*), you may search in Github and develop a version of yours. **It's free for individual use, charged for commercial uses.** Contact me at liuljwtt@foxmail.com

## Abouts

### Charging and Support Service

If you pay for some product and its service, you will get the support service for free. **BUT, please use the same email address to contact. I use email address to identify who you are, for now. Support Service is only available for customers who paid to me.**

### Why charging

Developing products cost resources, paying is a normal means of exchanging. Suitable fee is beneficial for further development. I will be very grateful if you acknowledge me and make a donation!
