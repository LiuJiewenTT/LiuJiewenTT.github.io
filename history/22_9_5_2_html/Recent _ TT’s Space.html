<h3 id="charging-and-support-service">Charging and Support Service</h3>

<p>If you pay for some product and its service, you will get the support service for free. <strong>BUT, please use the same email address to contact. I use email address to identify who you are, for now. Support Service is only available for customers who paid to me.</strong></p>

<h3 id="why-charging">Why charging</h3>

<p>Developing products cost resources, paying is a normal means of exchanging. Suitable fee is beneficial for further development. I will be very grateful if you acknowledge me and make a donation!</p>

<h3 id="my-effort-to-open-community">My effort to open community</h3>

<p>And I made effort to open community by customizing an MIT license. See it <a href="https://github.com/TTStudio-of-TTPeter/TTPeter-s-MIT-like-License">Here!</a>
This protocol is almost the same as MIT except for the commercial use aspect. The restriction is about how commercial use will be permitted so that developers also gain some benefits. The license is aimed to make a perfect balance between dream and survival of free software. It’s a rather rough protocol that has a rough criterion. This is best for small projects. In fact, I hope more people will choose this customized license when they’re about to choose MIT. For details, see it <a href="https://github.com/TTStudio-of-TTPeter/TTPeter-s-MIT-like-License">here!</a></p>
